## Brief
IoT has been all the rage over the past couple of years. The extensive use of sensors and wireless connectivity among devices has increased to the trend. The increase brings in turn, easily available technology for hobbyists to explore. Connecting everything to everything seems like a good idea. For e.g. how would you like to control your air conditioner from the comfort of your bed when you forget your remote in the other end of the room. We discuss similar IoT projects here.


### IoT-Based PM2.5 and PM10 Air Quality Monitoring System
This is an ESP32 NodeMCU-based Air Quality monitoring system to check particulate matter (PM), humidity, temperature, altitude and pressure levels. Various environmental conditions of the place are tested and displayed on the TFT display as well as on ThingSpeak IoT (Internet of Things) platform.

### ESP8266 based wireless web server
This ESP8266 based wireless web server project is built around an Arduino. Currently, ESP8266 is gaining popularity in the field of electronics because it is low-cost, reliable and easily available in the market. Most documents related to this module are in Mandarin (Chinese language) and information provided in the datasheet is not sufficient enough for using ESP8266 for an application.

### IoT Based Smart Camera
Presented here is a project that lets your Raspberry Pi (RPi) turn into an IoT based smart camera and then control and watch live video being captured by this camera on your smartphone from anywhere on the planet. You just need an Internet connection on your RPi and smartphone. This project explains the step-by-step procedure to build your own remote smart security camera.

### Air Pollution Meter
Presented here is an IoT enabled air pollution meter to monitor air quality on your smartphone using Blynk application and Arduino board. Blynk is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform to control Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the like over the Internet. In this project, Blynk provides a digital dashboard on your smartphone that displays real-time air quality readings for the immediate surroundings.

### Home Automation
IoT is rapidly transforming the destiny of devices which are placed at a core with a specified task in our world. These devices can interact among themselves and with humans. The extensive use of sensors is just one of the distinctive factors. That being said, there are various techniques to implement gesture control for home appliances too. Hand gestures are simple and easy to implement while using electronic components which are mentioned in this next IoT project.

### Windows 10 on Raspberry
Microsoft brings in added flavour to IoT using cloud connectivity and support. The devices connect to the windows 10 and communicate with each other in an instant. All you need to get started is a public release of Windows 10, windows 10 IoT core dashboard. Oh, and a Raspberry Pi 2.

### Smart Garage Door
Gone are the days when you had to kick open the garage door or use the bulky electronic key which falls out of battery power every now and then. If you would like to keep up with the trend, this project is for you. Designing this project would help you put away that annoying clicker that keeps getting lost. Using a smartphoneâ€™s built-in communication technology, this replaces the clicker with your smartphone.

### Automated Blinds
Automation is getting the best of everything around and even blinders are not spaces. Hilariously enough, if you wish to start setting up automation at home using your own efforts, it would be great to start with blinders. With you can win laurels while they open and close at your will. Happy DIY times are ahead. This next DIY is also being quoted as the cheapest DIY. What do you feel?

### Humidity And Temperature monitoring
Presented here is a humidity and temperature monitoring system using Arduino. In this project, humidity and temperature information from DHT-11 sensor is analysed graphically on ThingSpeak platform using Arduino MCU and ESP8266 Wi-Fi module.

### Baggage Tracker
When you say that only 1% of baggage is lost during air travel, it sounds like a very small number. However, when we move to absolute numbers, 1% from billions of travellers is still a huge number. The next bag that they lose might be yours. This DIY builds a system that tracks your baggage even while it is in the air. Build it, keep it in your bag and you can track all the details from your phone.

### Smart Trash Collector
In real-world use-case for a smart-city, a command centre could monitor the amount of trash in and around an area or city. The respective Municipal departments can optimise garbage pickup timings and personnel required to send vehicles to pick up trash to designated places while cutting down on expenses of fuel and vehicle emission. This next project designs a rather unique innovation using the Internet of things which is to monitor the usage trash in a smart trash can.

### IoT and Touch-Based Home Automation
We have seen various applications of IoT but what about adding the touch to it. In this project, we would be building a similar type of an IoT based Home Automation System.

### Communicating with Arduino through Android
Want to send text from your Android phone to your Arduino? This next project describes how to do so. All you need is an Android phone, an Arduino, an Arduino USB cable, a USB OTG cable and Android Studio. This good thing about this project, it can be made by people proficient with software.

### Alarm Clock
This project brings in a Raspberry Pi for people working with development boards. When a simple alarm clock is not enough and you need an alarm, clock controlled by your phone, this Raspberry Pi could come to your rescue. You would be able to program different radio stations per different alarms; e.g., a news channel for weekdays, music for weekends.

### Temperature transmission using Raspberry Pi
An IoT project idea went from idea to make with this next project. It demonstrates interfacing a Raspberry Pi to an I2C temperature sensor (TMP102) and then publishing the data to a Google sheet and graph. All you need is a Raspberry Pi, I2C temperature sensor and a google account. Hopefully, this next project helps you in designing this system.
